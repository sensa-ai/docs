## Subscription Levels and Their API Credit Limits
While some datasets are offered for free all of SensaAI's AI enhanced products are subject to API credit limits.  
SensaAI offers distinct subscription levels, each with a predefined monthly API credit limit. These subscription tiers are designed to cater to various user needs and demands. For an overview of credit limits offered for each subscription level please refer to <a href="https://sensaai.com/resources/pricing" target="_blank">SensaAI Pricing Plans</a>.

## API Credits Renewal Cycle
SensaAI's API credit limits utilize a monthly renewal cycle. Regardless of your subscription level, your API credit limit refreshes monthly. This renewal system ensures that you have a consistent and predictable supply of API credits, allowing you to plan your API usage effectively.

API credits serve as a currency that you expend with each API request. Your credit balance decreases with each request, and once you reach your monthly limit, you'll need to wait until the next month for your credits to reset.

Understanding your subscription's API credit limit is crucial for managing your API usage efficiently. SensaAI's monthly credit limits enable users to align their API consumption with their subscription tier while ensuring predictable and continuous access to the API's features and capabilities.
