# Authentication

Introduction to SensaAI API authorization.

---

To ensure that your interactions with our API are both seamless and secure, we have implemented robust authorization mechanisms, with API keys playing a pivotal role.

## Obtaining Your API Key

The SensaAI API uses API keys for authentication. To retrieve your API access key, please visit your <a href="https://sensaai.com/app/account-details" target="_blank">SensaAI Account Page</a>. This unique key serves as your secure gateway to our API, granting you the access you need while safeguarding your data.

## Secrecy Matters

Remember that your API access key is a secret! Do not share it with others. Treat it as you would any sensitive information, as it provides access to your SensaAI account and the data associated with it.

## Including Your API Key in Requests

All API requests should include your API key in the HTTP header as follows:
```bash
api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
By following this simple convention, you'll be able to make authenticated requests, ensuring that your interactions with SensaAI are both safe and effective.
