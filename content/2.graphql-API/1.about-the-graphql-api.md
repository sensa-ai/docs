# About the GraphQL API

The SensaAI GraphQL API offers flexibility and the ability to define precisely the data you want to fetch.

## Overview

Here are some quick links to get you up and running with the GraphQL API:

- [Authentication](/graphql-api/making-calls#authenticating-with-api-access-key)
- [Root endpoint](/graphql-api/making-calls#the-graphql-endpoint)
- [Schema introspection](/graphql-api/introduction-to-graphql#discovering-the-graphql-api)
- [Credit limits](/getting-started/api-credit-limits)

## About GraphQL

The [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/){:target="_blank"} data query language is:

- **A [specification](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/){:target="_blank"}.** The spec determines the validity of the [schema](/graphql-api/introduction-to-graphql#schema){:target="_blank"} on the API server. The schema determines the validity of client calls.

- **[Strongly typed](#about-the-graphql-schema-reference).** The schema defines an API's type system and all object relationships.

- **[Introspective](/graphql-api/introduction-to-graphql#discovering-the-graphql-api){:target="_blank"}.** A client can query the schema for details about the schema.

- **[Hierarchical](/graphql-api/making-calls).** The shape of a GraphQL call mirrors the shape of the JSON data it returns. Nested fields let you query for and receive only the data you specify in a single round trip.

- **An application layer.** GraphQL is not a storage model or a database query language. The _graph_ refers to graph structures defined in the schema, where [nodes](/graphql-api/introduction-to-graphql#node){:target="_blank"} define objects and [edges](/graphql-api/introduction-to-graphql#edge){:target="_blank"} define relationships between objects. The API traverses and returns application data based on the schema definitions, independent of how the data is stored.

## Why SensaAI is using GraphQL

SensaAI chose GraphQL because it offers significantly more flexibility for our users. The ability to define precisely the data you want&mdash;and _only_ the data you want&mdash;is a powerful advantage over traditional REST API endpoints. GraphQL lets you replace multiple REST requests with _a single call_ to fetch the data you specify.

## About the GraphQL schema reference

The reference docs in the sidebar are generated from the https://sensaai.com/graphiql GraphQL [schema](/graphql-api/introduction-to-graphql#schema){:target="_blank"}. All calls are validated and executed against the schema. Use these docs to find out what data you can call:

- Allowed operations: [queries](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Language.Operations){:target="_blank"} and [mutations](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Language.Operations){:target="_blank"}.

- Schema-defined types: [scalars](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#ScalarTypeDefinition){:target="_blank"}, [objects](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Objects){:target="_blank"}, [enums](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Enums){:target="_blank"}, [unions](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Unions){:target="_blank"}, and [input objects](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Input-Objects){:target="_blank"}.

You can access this same content via the [Explorer Docs sidebar](/graphql-api/explorer#accessing-the-sidebar-docs){:target="_blank"}. Note that you may need to rely on both the docs and the schema validation to successfully call the GraphQL API.
