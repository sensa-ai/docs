# Pagination in the SensaAI REST API

Pagination functionalities are crucial for efficiently handling large datasets. In this article, we'll explore how SensaAI has implemented pagination enhance the REST API's usability.

SensaAI, known for its rich AI-driven capabilities, often deals with large volumes of data. Retrieving large datasets in a single API call can be cumbersome and resource-intensive. This is where pagination comes into play.

Pagination in the SensaAI API is a mandatory practice when dealing with large datasets. The REST API employs two essential query parameters, "limit" and "offset," to facilitate efficient data retrieval.

**Limit**: The "limit" parameter allows you to specify how many records you want in each page of the response. By setting an appropriate "limit," you can control the number of items returned, optimizing performance and data transfer.

**Offset**: The "offset" parameter is used to determine the starting point for fetching records. It enables you to navigate through large datasets by specifying where to begin. By incrementally adjusting the "offset," you can systematically access different sections of the data.

**Combining "limit" and "offset"** provides a powerful mechanism for paginating through extensive datasets efficiently. By making multiple requests with changing "offset" values, developers can navigate through the entirety of SensaAI's data without overloading the server or wasting bandwidth.
